## Introduction

Welcome to the **Disable Parking Israel** project! This project aims to fetch data from the [www.gov.il](https://data.gov.il/dataset/rechev-tag-nachim/resource/c8b9f9c8-4612-4068-934f-d4acd2e3c06e) API and provide valuable information related to disabled parking in Israel. The goal is to create a tool that helps users access and utilize data about disabled parking spaces efficiently.

## Goal

The primary goal of the project is to retrieve relevant information from the [www.gov.il API](https://data.gov.il/dataset/rechev-tag-nachim/resource/c8b9f9c8-4612-4068-934f-d4acd2e3c06e). By fetching data from this API, the project aims to contribute to the accessibility and convenience of disabled parking information, benefiting both disabled individuals and the community at large.

## API Source

The project relies on data provided by the [www.gov.il API](https://data.gov.il/dataset/rechev-tag-nachim/resource/c8b9f9c8-4612-4068-934f-d4acd2e3c06e). This API serves as a valuable source of information regarding disabled parking spaces in Israel. By tapping into this data source, we aim to create a user-friendly application that helps people find accurate and up-to-date information about disabled parking availability.

## Valid Car Plate Numbers

To facilitate testing and development, the following car plate numbers are considered valid inputs for the application:

- 161101 / 161-101
- 1000511 / 100-05-11
- 91874401 / 918-74-401

Feel free to use these examples for testing the application's functionality.
