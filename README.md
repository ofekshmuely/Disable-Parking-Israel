## Introduction

Welcome to the **Disable Parking Israel** project! This project is dedicated to helping users determine whether a car number is linked to a handicapped individual. By utilizing data from the [www.gov.il](https://data.gov.il/dataset/rechev-tag-nachim/resource/c8b9f9c8-4612-4068-934f-d4acd2e3c06e) API, the application aims to provide accurate information about disabled parking status associated with a given car number.

## Goal

The primary objective of the **Disable Parking Israel** project is to simplify the process of identifying whether a car number corresponds to a handicapped person's vehicle. This is achieved by querying the [www.gov.il API](https://data.gov.il/dataset/rechev-tag-nachim/resource/c8b9f9c8-4612-4068-934f-d4acd2e3c06e) database and presenting the relevant information to the user.

## API Source

The project relies on data made available through the [www.gov.il API](https://data.gov.il/dataset/rechev-tag-nachim/resource/c8b9f9c8-4612-4068-934f-d4acd2e3c06e). This API is a crucial source of information about disabled parking in Israel. By accessing this API, our application aims to provide users with up-to-date and reliable data to make informed decisions.

## Usage

To use the application, simply enter a car number into the provided input field on the [demo page](https://ofekshmuely.github.io/Disable-Parking-Israel/). The application will then query the API database and display whether the entered car number is associated with a handicapped person's vehicle or not.

## Valid Car Plate Numbers

For testing purposes, you can use the following car plate numbers as valid inputs:

- 161101 / 161-101
- 1000511 / 100-05-11
- 91874401 / 918-74-401

These examples can help you explore the application's functionality.
